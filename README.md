# About The OS

Welcome to {PyOS}! An idie project made by Aki which includes an operating system, and a few programs to start
This was made with Python, Hopes and Dreams (yes it was annoying to code this) 

This OS runs as a SaaS (Software as a Service) and will contain mainly programs seperating a booter (which is honestly terrible), login page, and a main Desktop.

The significance of the project is just as a passion project testing my coding skills in python and helping myself with making more interactive and unique software powered by python.

Please do NOT Add any programs to th Programs folder, especially as it will be hard to know what programs are what while it is running in the OS.
